# Code-Wars Coding Challenges
This repository is an accumulation of all the coding challenges I have completed on www.Codewars.com. I have done at least one challenge everyday to strengthen my Javascript ability. Each challenge has the description of the challenge, my solution and is organized based on the type of problem it was. Feel free to explore.

## How It's Made
This repo is 100% Javascript and covers a broad range of topics.

## Lessons Learned
Daily Codewars challenges greatly improved my knowledge of Javascript. Using built in methods and functions everyday resulted aided in the JS syntax to become second nature to me. After hundreds of challenges, and looking at other peoples answers, resulted in my code becoming much more digestable and succinct.
