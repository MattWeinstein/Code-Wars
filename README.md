# Code-Wars Coding Challenges
This repository is an accumulation of all the coding challenges I have completed on www.Codewars.com. I have done at least one challenge every day to strengthen my JavaScript ability. Each challenge has the description of the challenge, my solution, and is organized based on the type of problem it was. Feel free to explore.

## How It's Made
This repo is 100% Javascript and covers a broad range of coding problems. All problems are from Codewars.com.

## Lessons Learned
Solving a coding challenge every day vastly inproved my knowledge and proficiency in JavaScript syntax. Using built in methods, objects and properties on a daily basis helped solidify the language in my brain. I enjoyed being able to gauge my progress based on the difficulty of the problem, the time it took to solve it, and the number of google searches I made while solving. Noting my reduced dependency on Google for JS syntax was an empowering feeling. 

In addition to JS syntax, daily Codewars challenges helped me learn how to solve coding problems, and more importantly, how to debug your own code. When presented with a problem, I can now conceptualize many ways of how to solve the problem before typing a single charachter. 

Fixing code issues in my failed solutions became critical to being succesful at solving problems. Months ago I would find myself staring at a code block, not understanding why it may not be working. I eventually understood that if my code is not functioning as designed, the computer has an extremely rational reason why it is not performing the task I'd like it to do - it is my job to figure this out.

The two biggest takeaways from this finding were to test code while I write it, and to check every component of the code. The most trivial charachter or variable can be the reason your program is not functioning, and no line of code should be assumed to work when debugging. Testing the code throughout the solving process made it far easier to find and resolve the issue.
